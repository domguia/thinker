# Experiment Log

We got the error below only on GPU, the code worked well on CPU!
```RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation: [torch.cuda.FloatTensor [27, 4, 606, 8]], which is output 0 of AsStridedBackward0, is at version 19; expected version 18 instead. Hint: the backtrace further above shows the operation that failed to compute its gradient. The variable in question was changed in there or anywhere later. Good luck!```

Because of:
`self.k_cache[:, begin_insert_idx:end_insert_idx] = k`
